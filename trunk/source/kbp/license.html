<h2>KBPublisher License Agreement</h2>
This document contains the End User License Agreement between Double Jade LLC,
herein referred to as "the company", "we", "us", and "our",
and the End User (herein referred to as "you", "your", "yours", etc.).
By installing and using KBPublisher (herein referred to as "the software"), you are
agreeing to these terms and conditions.
<ol>
<li><b>TERMS AND DEFINITIONS</b><br><br>

	<ol>
	<li>An "instance" of the software is a unique installation of the software
	on a system capable of running it, whether used for production purposes or
	for testing.
	</li>
	
	<li>A "admin user" is a unique account installed in an instance of KBPublisher.
	Depending on their privileges, this user can create and/or manage articles
	and/or administer the knowledgebase.
	</li>
	
	<li>A "end user" is a unique account installed in an instance of KBPublisher, used
	by one or more persons to read articles, download files and browse your
	knowledgebase.
	</li>
	</ol>
	
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>RIGHT TO RUN</b><br><br>

	Your purchase of a KBPublisher license grants you the right to make use of a
	single instance of the software. You may temporarily install a second instance of
	KBPublisher on an internal development server for testing and deployment
	planning, but only one instance of KBPublisher shall be in operation (available
	for access to your admin users or end users).

	<br><br>
	If you wish to run more than one instance of KBPublisher, you must purchase an
	additional license for each additional instance.

	<br><br>
	Modifications to the software or database to circumvent the one-license-one-board rule are prohibited.

</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>LICENSEE</b><br><br>

	The Software is licensed only to you. You may not rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, pledge, 
	transfer or otherwise dispose of the Software in any form, 
	on a temporary or permanent basis, without the prior written consent of Double Jade LLC. 
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>ACCURATE LICENSE INFORMATION</b><br><br>
	
	Your right to use a KBPublisher instance under a purchased license requires you
	to provide accurate information regarding the location (or planned
	location) of the software instance. You must maintain accurate contact
	information in your Members Area profile and maintain accurate location
	details for your software instance(s).

	<br><br>
	From time to time, we may inspect your registration integrity. 
	No information about your server will be collected in this process. 
	The only information checked will be your license number and the domain on which KBPublisher is run.
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>ALTERATION OF SOURCE CODE</b><br><br>

	If you have purchased KBPublisher, which includes viewable source
	code, you are permitted to make modifications to the software to suit your
	needs, subject to these conditions:

	<ol>
	<li>You may not distribute the software or any portion thereof, or permit or
	cause to be exposed any portion of the source code to any other party
	without the express written consent of Double Jade LLC.

	</li><li>You may not attempt to circumvent any license validation checks.

	</li><li>All copyright notices must remain intact in the source code.
	</li></ol>
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>REMOVAL OF COPYRIGHT NOTICES</b><br><br>

	If you have not purchased a copyright removal license, all copyright
	notices included in the software (including in source code and templates)
	must remain intact. This includes "Powered by KBPublisher" and similar notices.
	You may, however, change the appearance of all other aspects of the
	interface.

	<br><br>
	If you have purchased the copyright removal license, you may remove 
	the "powered by" link from one installation of KBPublisher.	
	The copyright removal license does not allow you to remove or alter 
	the KBPublisher logo in the KBPublisher control panel (Admin Area).	
	
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>CIRCUMVENTION OF SOFTWARE LIMITS</b><br><br>

	If you have purchased a version of the software that includes restrictions
	on the maximum number of admin users, or the maximum number of
	and/or articles, you may not attempt to circumvent the internal checks
	performed by the software to ensure compliance with these restrictions. 
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>VERIFICATION OF MINIMUM SERVER REQUIREMENTS</b><br><br>

	If you have purchased a license for a standalone instance of KBPublisher, it is
	your responsibility to verify your target equipment meets the minimum
	requirements specified by the software's documentation. Refunds are not offered.
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>LICENSE TRANSFER</b><br><br>
	
	We may, at our discretion, allow you to transfer your license to another party, providing the license: 

	<ol>
		<li>has not already been transferred</li>
		<li>was purchased more than 4 months ago</li>
		<li>the members area access is active</li>
		<li>the license was purchased at full cost (for example a 2nd license purchased 
		    at a discount can not be transferred)</li>
	</ol>
</li>

<br><br>
<li><b>PUBLICITY</b><br><br>

	You grant Double Jade LLC the right to include your company's name as a 
	customer on Double Jade's website and other advertising and promotional materials.  
	Within thirty business days after your written request, Double Jade LLC will 
	remove your company's name from the Double Jade website and will cease to 
	include the name in Double Jade's other advertising and promotional materials.
