; Normally you only need to update that file, it will affect  Admin and Public areas
; if you wish do not affect Admin Area (keep it in English for example) copy all content from file 
; (admin/lang/[your_lang]/user_msg.ini) to this file 
; and translate it. All your changes will be in Public Area only.
